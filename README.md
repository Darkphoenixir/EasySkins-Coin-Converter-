üõ†Ô∏è Customizing the Conversion Rates
The conversion rates for various currencies are defined in the CONVERSION_RATES object within the JavaScript section of index.html. These rates are illustrative and you MUST adjust them to match the actual conversion rates from EasySkins coins to each specific Steam currency.

Open the index.html file in a text editor.

Locate the CONVERSION_RATES object in the <script> section:

const CONVERSION_RATES = {
    'UAH': { rate: 0.43, symbol: '‚Ç¥' }, // Example: 100 coins = 43 UAH
    'USD': { rate: 0.01, symbol: '$' },  // Example: 100 coins = 1 USD
    'EUR': { rate: 0.009, symbol: '‚Ç¨' }, // Example: 100 coins = 0.9 EUR
    // ... and so on for other currencies
};

Modify the rate value for each currency to reflect the correct conversion from 1 EasySkins coin to that currency. You can also add more currencies to this object if needed.
